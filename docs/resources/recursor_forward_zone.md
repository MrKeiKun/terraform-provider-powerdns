# powerdns_recursor_forward_zone

Provides a PowerDNS recursor forward zone resource for managing DNS forwarding configuration via the recursor API.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "powerdns_recursor_forward_zone" "example" {
  zone    = "example.com"
  servers = ["192.0.2.1", "192.0.2.2"]
}

resource "powerdns_recursor_forward_zone" "internal" {
  zone    = "internal.company.com"
  servers = ["10.0.0.53"]
}

resource "powerdns_recursor_forward_zone" "secure_forward" {
  zone              = "secure.company.com"
  servers           = ["10.0.0.53"]
  recursion_desired = true
  notify_allowed    = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

This resource supports the following arguments:

- `zone` - (Required) The DNS zone name to forward queries for.
- `servers` - (Required) A list of DNS server IP addresses to forward queries to for this zone.
- `recursion_desired` - (Optional) Whether the RD (Recursion Desired) bit is set. When true, the recursor will set the RD bit on outgoing queries. Default is true.
- `notify_allowed` - (Optional) Whether or not to permit incoming NOTIFY to wipe cache for the domain. Default is false.

## Notes

- This resource requires the `recursor_server_url` to be configured in the provider.
- Forward zone configuration is managed through the `forward-zones` recursor setting.
- Multiple forward zones can be configured independently.
- Changes take effect immediately in the running recursor.
- The `notify_allowed` field allows incoming NOTIFY messages to wipe cache for the domain.
